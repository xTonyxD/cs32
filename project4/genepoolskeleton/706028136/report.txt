This was slightly more difficult. First and foremost was finding the isLoaded bug. I guess I missed it during class, but I spent two hours figuring that part out. That was annoying. Nullpointers were also my other biggest issue; sometimes I'd consider a nullpointer a full parent (since I assumed half siblings counted as siblings), and then siblings would output a large list of people with no known parents. Another issue was with finding grandparents; I was making a new parent when the parent already existed, and not making a new parent when the parent already existed. This didn't throw a null pointer error at me probably because the parent already existed, so there were just duplicates sitting in the list. Very annoying.
